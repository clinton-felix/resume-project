                        <h4>My Journey and Experience as a Developer </h4>
                        <br>
                        <p>I wrote my first Hello World Code in 2019, just a few months after I finished my first Degree
                            It was a great Experience because I now understood how the internet worls, at least the static
                            web. A few short months Later, I began to learn other much more intriguing aspects of programming.
                            It was a passion; and I was ready to stretch it to the limits!
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Before I knew it, a few short months afterwards, I had mastered the basics and was now writting
                            server and client side codes. My Newbie self had made a lot of progress! I ventured into other aspects
                            of coding, including a bit of php, react.js, python, Django and ultimately Solidity; for writing 
                            Blockchain(ERC20) based applications and Ethereun Smartcontracts!
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I still have so much to learn, but I am confident that I will be a great addition to your team and also 
                            help your organization position itself for relevance with your both existing infrastructure and future 
                            infrastructure like Blockchain! Talk Soon!
